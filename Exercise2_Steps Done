1.	Setting up Virtual Box and Cloudera using the following link:
http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-2017/homeworks/hw0/tutorialv3.pdf

2.	Virtual Machine includes:
•	CentOS 6.4
•	JDK 7 
•	Hadoop 2.5.0
•	Eclipse 4.2.6

3.	Hadoop can run in three modes:
•	Standalone mode
•	Pseudo-distributed mode
•	Fully-distributed mode

4.	In this exercise we are going to run the two input files:
http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt and http://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/100-0.txt in Standalone and Pseudo-distributed mode.

5.	Standalone Mode:
6.	Pseudo-distributed mode:
a.	We are given the WordCount.java file. Copy and Paste the code in Eclipse by providing appropriate class name.
b.	Create cloudera folder in HDFS. For this we need to first login as root user:
i.	sudo su
ii.	hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera
iii.	exit
c.	Create input directory in HDFS:
i.	hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/wordcount /user/cloudera/wordcount/input
d.	Place the input file in the above created directory:
i.	hadoop fs -put file* /user/cloudera/wordcount/input
Here, file* - this is the filepath of the input file.
e.	Compile the package installation of CDH:
i.	mkdir -p build
ii.	javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* /home/cloudera/workspace/WordCount/src/edu/stanford/cs246/wordcount/WordCount.java -d build -Xlint
f.	Create a JAR file for WordCount:
i.	jar -cvf wordcount.jar -C build/ .
g.	Runt the WordCount from JAR file by passing the input and output directories:
i.	hadoop jar wordcount.jar org.myorg.WordCount /user/cloudera/wordcount/input /user/cloudera/wordcount/output
h.	To fetch the output on the screen:
i.	hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/wordcount/output/*
